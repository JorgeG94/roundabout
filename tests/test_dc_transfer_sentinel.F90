!! SENTINEL: `transfer()` inside a `do concurrent` must be correct.
!!
!! This test asserts the RIGHT behaviour.  It is EXPECTED TO FAIL on nvfortran
!! today, and tests/CMakeLists.txt marks it `WILL_FAIL TRUE` for that compiler
!! only.  So:
!!
!!   * nvfortran, bug present  -> binary fails -> WILL_FAIL -> ctest PASSES (quiet)
!!   * nvfortran, bug FIXED    -> binary passes -> WILL_FAIL -> ctest FAILS
!!         ^ that is the notification.  When this goes red on NVHPC, NVIDIA has
!!           fixed it: drop the WILL_FAIL, delete the `dc-transfer` lint, and
!!           rdb_ocean_chksum can move to `do concurrent`.
!!   * every other compiler    -> no WILL_FAIL -> must pass normally, so a
!!         regression elsewhere is caught the ordinary way.
!!
!! The bug (nvfortran 26.5, -stdpar=gpu -gpu=cc70,mem:separate): a plain
!! elementwise `got(i) = transfer(x(i), 0_int64)` in a `do concurrent` gets
!! ~95% of elements wrong (94645/100000), reading a SHIFTED element --
!! `got 0x4008000000000000` (3.0) where `0x4000000000000000` (2.0) was
!! expected.  No reduction is involved; it is an index/scoping miscompile in
!! the do-concurrent lowering.  The identical expression under
!! `!$acc parallel loop` is CORRECT, which is why rdb_ocean_chksum stays on
!! OpenACC.  This test IS the reproducer -- it needs no reduction, no
!! int64 accumulator and no popcnt, only `transfer` in a `do concurrent`.
