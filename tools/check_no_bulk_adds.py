"""Refuse commits that add a suspiciously large number of NEW files.

Why this exists
---------------
This worktree carries dozens of untracked files at any time -- scratch runs,
draft plans, in-progress examples.  `git add -A` sweeps all of them into the
index, and the resulting commit silently carries unrelated work.  That has
happened repeatedly; the standing "use `git add -u`" rule is not a control,
because it depends on remembering it at exactly the wrong moment.

`.gitignore` removes the unambiguous scratch from the addable set, but the
pending work (docs/ plans, examples/, validation_examples/) deliberately stays
visible -- it might still get committed on purpose.  This hook guards THAT
remainder.

The heuristic
-------------
A deliberate commit adds a handful of new files: a module and its test, a doc,
a validation case.  An accidental `git add -A` adds dozens spanning unrelated
top-level directories.  So: fail when a commit adds more than MAX_ADDS new
files, and report them so the author can see what got swept in.

This is intentionally a blunt count rather than a cleverer "are these files
related" test -- a blunt rule that fires reliably beats a subtle one that can
be argued with.

Override
--------
Legitimate bulk additions exist (vendoring, a new validation suite, the
coastal/ocean split).  Set RDB_ALLOW_BULK_ADD=1 for that commit:

    RDB_ALLOW_BULK_ADD=1 git commit ...

The override is deliberately explicit and per-commit: it forces the decision to
be conscious rather than habitual.
