"""Drift gate for the memory-accounting `bytes()` functions.

Fortran has no reflection, so a per-slot `bytes()` count is only as complete
as the human who wrote it: add an allocatable array (or a nested slot) to a
type and forget the matching term, and the counted footprint silently
under-reports.  The runtime reconciliation in `rdb_mem_report`
(counted-vs-measured device mapping) catches it eventually — but only on a
GPU run, and only once.  This hook catches it at commit time.

RULE 1 — completeness (opt-in per type; a type is only checked once it HAS a
`bytes()`): for every derived type that binds `procedure :: bytes => <fn>`,
every COUNTABLE component must appear as `this%<name>` somewhere in <fn>.  A
component is countable when it is

  * an intrinsic allocatable (`real/integer/logical/complex, allocatable`), or
  * a component whose own declared type itself has a `bytes()` (nested slots
    and shared buffers — e.g. `scratch_3d_buffer_t`, `tracer_t`).

Derived components whose type has NO `bytes()` are not required by rule 1 —
rule 2 is what stops that being a free pass.

RULE 2 — existence (the blind spot rule 1 leaves): a type that has NO
`bytes()` at all used to be INVISIBLE to this hook, however much device
memory it mapped.  That is how `diag_var_t` (~3.2 GB), `bt_wide_t`
(~436 MB), `evp_workspace_t` (~154 MB) and `diag_mask_t` all went uncounted
while the hook stayed green.  So: if a type declares an intrinsic
allocatable component AND that component name appears in an `!$acc enter
data` / `!$acc declare` clause in the same file, the type is DEVICE-MAPPED
and must have a `bytes()` — or be listed in `DEVICE_MAPPED_EXEMPT` below
with a reason.

`DEVICE_MAPPED_EXEMPT` is a frozen BASELINE of the types that were already
device-mapped-and-uncounted when rule 2 was introduced.  It is not a
blessing — it is the to-do list.  Do not add to it to silence a new type;
give the new type a `bytes()` and wire the term into its parent's total.

Still NOT checked (known remaining gap): module-level `save` allocatables.
They have no owning type, so neither rule reaches them — every device
buffer in `src/comm/**` and `tracer_scratch_t`'s module storage is outside
this hook.  Only the runtime counted-vs-measured reconciliation in
`rdb_mem_report` sees those.
