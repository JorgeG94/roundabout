!! Reusable 3D scratch-buffer type.
module rdb_scratch_3d
   !! Single owner for `(n1, n2, n3)` scratch arrays.  Every column-
   !! local kernel slot (continuity, coriolis_adv, pressure_force,
   !! lateral-mix vorticity scratch, KPP solve scratch) declares its
   !! per-step workspace as a `scratch_3d_buffer_t` rather than as a
   !! bare `real(wp), allocatable :: foo(:, :, :)`.
   !!
   !! Why centralise this:
   !!   1. **One allocation policy.**  The strided hybrid loop
   !!      pattern (see `src/core/ocean/README.md`) sizes every
   !!      column-local scratch at `(stride, stride, nz_ml)` with
   !!      `stride = ocean_state%column_stride`.  Putting that policy
   !!      in one type means a new slot follows the convention by
   !!      construction, not by remembering to copy-paste it.
   !!   2. **One GPU-mapping site.**  `enter_data` / `exit_data`
   !!      live on the type, so every slot that uses this type
   !!      inherits the mapping for free — no per-slot directive
   !!      copies to keep in sync.
   !!   3. **One resize site.**  If a kernel discovers it needs a
   !!      different shape mid-run (rare — only happens if `stride`
   !!      becomes dynamic), `ensure_size` reallocates and remaps in
   !!      one place.
   !!   4. **Cheap finite-check.**  Phase 6 debug guards walk every
   !!      `scratch_3d_buffer_t` instance after each slot kernel and
   !!      verify no NaN / out-of-range leaked into scratch.
   !!
   !! Phase 2 status: alloc + GPU enter_data / exit_data live.  Phase
   !! 1+ items (`ensure_size`, `assert_finite`) still pending.

   public :: scratch_3d_buffer_t
   ! Non-polymorphic device-attach entry points.  Owning slots call these
   ! directly (with a `type(scratch_3d_buffer_t)` actual) so the OpenMP
   ! map base is the heap object, not a polymorphic stack box (the AMD
   ! libomptarget cross-slot-overlap fix).  The type-bound `enter_data` /
   ! `exit_data` are thin select-type wrappers over these.

         !! True between `init` and `destroy`.  Prefer this to
         !! `allocated(this%data)` — tracks GPU device attachment too.

      ! ---- Declared shape ----
      integer :: n1 = 0
         !! First-dim size, typically `stride` (or `stride+1` on
         !! face-located buffers).
      integer :: n2 = 0
         !! Second-dim size, typically `stride`.
      integer :: n3 = 0
         !! Third-dim size, typically `nz_ml` (or `nz_ml+1` for
         !! layer-interface buffers).

      ! ---- Payload ----
      real(wp), allocatable :: data(:, :, :)
         !! The scratch storage.  Access in a kernel as
         !! `slot%scratch%data(i, j, k)`.  Note: this is a *single*
         !! derived type (not array-of-derived-types), so the
         !! `!$acc` indirection bug from the array-of-DT pattern
         !! does not apply.

      ! ---- Optional name ----
      character(len=32) :: name = ""
         !! Human-readable tag for diagnostics + debug guard
         !! messages ("kpp_bulk_ri_scratch", "ppm_h_face_left_x", ...).
